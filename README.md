# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Overview of the Kaggle Titanic Competition

The [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) is a popular machine learning challenge that focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, which sank in 1912. Participants are given a dataset containing information about the passengers, such as age, gender, class of travel, and more. The primary goal is to use this data to build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a passenger survived the disaster.

## Contents of My Code

### Repository
- [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data): Contains the datasets provided by Kaggle (train.csv and test.csv).
- [Notebook](https://github.com/pratheeksha11/Titanic_Survival_Prediction_Kaggle/blob/main/titanic-survival-prediction.ipynb): Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step analysis and model building.

### Key Features of the Code
- **Data Exploration**: Analysis of different features in the dataset, such as age, sex, and class, to understand their impact on survival rates.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques employed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize the data.
- **Model Selection**: Random Forest is the model being used in this project
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Process of fine-tuning model parameters for optimal performance.

## Final Output of the Code

The final output of my code is a predictive model that determines the likelihood of survival for each passenger in the test dataset. The model's predictions are saved in a file (`submission.csv`), which can be submitted to the Kaggle competition for evaluation. The submission file includes passenger IDs and their corresponding survival predictions (1 for survived, 0 for did not survive).


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in making predictions based on historical data. It also highlights the importance of data preprocessing and feature engineering in building effective models.
